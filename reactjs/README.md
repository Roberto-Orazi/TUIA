# React course

### Add js code to a website
- Between <Script> tags
```
<script>
    alert('Hello')
</script>
```
This is for short scripts or old websites.
Its difficult to maintain.

- via <Script import
```
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
Separate html from js
Maintaining compelx js is easuer
